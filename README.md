# Samanta Content Evaluator

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for **Samanta Content Evaluator**, a tool that helps you assess the quality of your written content. Whether you're a writer, editor, or just curious about the content you encounter, this guide will show you how to use it effectively.

## What is Samanta Content Evaluator

Samanta Content Evaluator is like a digital content detective. It can tell you two important things about text: who wrote it (was it a person or a computer?), and how confident it is about its conclusion. Additionally, it can check if the text has been copied from somewhere else and provide some simple facts about the text, like how long it is and how many sentences and paragraphs it has.

Using Samanta Content Evaluator is easy! Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

Step 1: Accessing the Application

- To begin, open your internet browser (like Google Chrome or Firefox).
- Type in or click on [this link](https://www.uxlivinglab.net/samantacontentevaluator/wp-admin/admin.php?page=samanta) .

Step 2: Content Quality Assessment

- Once you're on the website, look for a box or a place where you can type or paste the text you want to evaluate.
- After you've entered the text, press a button or click "Check."

Step 3: Understanding the Results

- Samanta Content Evaluator will give you a report with information about the text.
- It will tell you if it thinks a person or a computer wrote the text (you'll want to see "human" for most content).
- You'll also see a percentage that shows how confident Samanta is about its conclusion (higher percentages are better).
- Samanta can even check if the text looks like it's been copied from somewhere else and provide some basic facts about it, like how many words, sentences, and paragraphs it has.

Step 4: Customizing the Look

- If you don't like the way the website looks, don't worry! You can change it.
- Look for a place in the settings where you can choose between a "Default," "Dark," or "Light" theme. Pick the one you like best, and the website will change its colors.

Step 5: Checking Your Credits

- Samanta Content Evaluator keeps track of how many text evaluations you can do. It's like having credits to use.
- To see how many evaluations you have left, go to the app's settings (there should be a link or a button).
- It will tell you how many credits you have. Each content check uses 25 credits.

That's it! You've successfully used Samanta Content Evaluator to assess your text.
